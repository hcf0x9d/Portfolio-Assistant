# Meet Scribbles (WIP)

Scribbles is my interview assistant.  He is an owl who knows a thing or
two about me and my skillsets.

Scribbles is a flat JavaScript implementation of the API.AI system for
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  For the time being, Scribbles
is kind of dumb.  But that's simply because I haven't programmed him with
much yet.

## Some of Scribbles' skills

Scribbles knows the basic small talk that is built in to API.AI, but I am
also working with him on being able to provide:

- Current weather in a location
    - `What's the weather like in San Diego?`
- Information about my knowledge and skillset
- What I have been working on
    - `What has Jason been doing?`
- Resume information, including providing you with a resume

Feel free to play around with Scribbles, again, until I teach him more,
he's going to be pretty dumb.

## Tech used:

- ES6 JavaScript (not transpiled, so you need a good, modern browser)
- API.AI
- CSS Animations
- webkitSpeechRecognition (again, modern browser required)
